IAM Users
=============
-Root users can access permissions to IAM user , Billing and resources.
-Best practice is to use IAM user for resources.
-We can create policies while creating users.

Method of creating : 
    1.Search IAM in console
    2.Goto users and create user option.
    3.We will get ARN ..This is the resource ID.we will use this in resource sharing.
    4.Enabling console premission will give the permisions to access aws console to the user.
      We will get a url to console for user.
      Its will be remain as IAM user..Not a root user..So it will only have a limited access.
