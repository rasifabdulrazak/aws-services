Databases In general
=============================
1. Database is nothing but a system that store database
2. Relational and Non-Relational
3. SQL
4. Relation between Tables
5. Schema : structure of tabales
6. NOSQL
7. No structure just key value pais

Database in EC2
==================
1. All in one ec2 => Not recomeneded
2. Database in seperate ec2 or managed Databases
3. OS level permissions in ec2 is possible,Vendor demand,Tuning
4. We have to manage everything like backups.Best to choose RDS for scaling apps.but more controlls
5. EC2 is running in single A-Z.
6. Referece : https://youtu.be/rM_c7K0-tC0?si=-woKOtaSUEg01bFs

RDS:
==============
1. Database as a service
2. Evrything manage by aws
3. Just setup our database
4. Amazon aurora more fast
5. RDS connects with CNAME, RDS uses standard database engines
6. The database can be optimised
7. Billing is per instance for storage allocation

setup:
======
1. Create subnet groups
2. Every instance will have be an endpoint
3. Enabling all the rquirments we need while creating

Migrate DB from Ec2 to RDS
======================
1. Get The dump of your existing DB on EC2
2. Connect to your RDS DB instance
3. Migrate the DB dump that you have taken in step 1 to RDS
4. Verify if all data is available

RDS Multi-AZ (High-Availabilty)
==============================
1. RDS Access ONLY via database CNAME. The CNAME will point at the primary instance.
   You cannot access the standby replica for any reason via RDS
2. the standby replica cannot be used for extra capacity
3. Synchronous replication
4. Multi-Az feature is not free tier, extra infrastructure for standby 
   Generally twice the price 
5. The standby replicas cannot be accessed directly unless a failure occures.
6. Failover is highly available, not fualt tolerent
7. Same region
8. Backups taken from standby (removes performance impacts).
9. AZ outage, primalry failure,manual fialover, instance type change, and spftware patching

RDS Backup and restore
========================
RPO (Recovery point objective)
1.Time between last backup and when the failure occured.
2. Amount of maximum data loss
3. Influences technical sollution and cost 
4. Business usaully provides an RPO value

RTO (Recovery time objective)
1. Time betweeen the DR event and full Recovery
2. influenced by process,staff,tech and documentation

Backups
1.First snapshot is FULL size of consumed data
2.Manual snapshot will remian in youur accouutn even after the life of the snapshot. These need to be deleted manually
3.Automatic Snapshots
4.Every 5 minutes tranlsation logs are saved to s3. A database can then be restored to a 5 min snaphot in time
5.Automatic cleanups can be anywhere from 0 to 35 days.
6.When you deleted the database, they can be retained but they will expire based on thier retention period
7. When performing a restore , RDS creates a new RDS with a new endpoint address.
8.When restoring a manual snapshot,you are setting it to a single point in time.This Influences the RPO value.
9.Automated backups are diffrent,any 5 minute point in time
10.Backups are restored and transaction logs are replayed to bring DB to desired point in time
11.restires arent fast,think about RTO

RDS Read Replicas
=================
1. Kept in sync using asynchronous replication
2. It is written fully to the primary instance.Once its stored on disk, it is then pushed to the replica.This means there could be a small lag. These can be created in the same region or a diffrent region. This is a cross region replication.
3. % direct read-replicas per DB instance
4. Each of these provides an additional instance of read performance
5. This allows you to scale out read operations for an instance
6. Read replicas can chain,but lag will become a problem
7. Can provide global performance improvement
